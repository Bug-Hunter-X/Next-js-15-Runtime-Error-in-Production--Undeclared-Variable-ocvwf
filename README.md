# Next.js 15 Runtime Error in Production: Undeclared Variable

This repository demonstrates a runtime error that occurs in Next.js 15 production mode when an undeclared variable is accessed. The error is subtle and might not be caught during development.

## Bug Description
The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`myVariable`) that's not defined anywhere. This results in a runtime error in production, but might not be immediately apparent during development.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the application for production.
4. Run `npm start` to start the production server.
5. Navigate to `/about`. You'll encounter a runtime error in your browser's console.

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file shows the corrected version. The problem was resolved by simply declaring the variable before using it or removing the line that caused the error if the variable is not needed.

## Additional Notes
This issue highlights the importance of rigorous testing, particularly when deploying Next.js applications to production.  Using a linter and strict TypeScript settings would help prevent such issues.
